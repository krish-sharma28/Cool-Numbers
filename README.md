## 2. How to run the program: 
### Open the terminal, navigate to the folder containing the files, and run: python main.py

## 3. How to use the program: 
### When the program starts, you'll see a welcome message followed by introduction. After read through all the words, you'll see a prompt like this: What would you like to do?

### You can type one of the following options (case-insensitive):
#### - play: Starts a new game.

#### - rules: Displays how the game works and optionally opens a video tutorial.

#### - leaderboard:Show a list of top winners.

#### - exit: Quits the program.

### If you type anything other than those four keywords, youâ€™ll get an error message prompting you to try again.

### When playing the game: 
#### 1. After typing "play", you'll be prompted to enter all player names. Enter each name followed by pressing Enter. When finished, type done.
#### 2. You'll then enter the number of rounds you'd like to play (e.g., 5).
#### 3. A random set of four numbers (a "card") will be displayed. 
#### 4. The first player who solves it types their name.
#### 5. That player is then asked to input a solution using ______?????(required input format)
#### 6. The program will use the ___??? function to check if your solution is correct or not. If the input is evaluated to exactly 24, the player earns points. Otherwise, no point is awarded. Also, the player can type "skip" if no one solves the round. 
#### 7. After all rounds are completed, the final scores for each player will be displayed.
